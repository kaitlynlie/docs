      **Troubleshooting process:**
      1. I right-clicked on the missing icon and selected "Inspect Element," receiving a 404 error code for all 3 icons in the console.

      2. Looking at
      the URLs for the .svg files, I saw that the .svg was from Lucide, so I went to the Lucide website and found that these icons did not exist in the icon set.

      3. I went to docs.json to double-check the icon library. When hovering over the
      property in the IDE, the tooltip indicated that the default was supposed to be "fontawesome," not
      "lucide," so I decided to switch it to fontawesome instead and reloaded
      the page. The three missing icons ended up loading with the correct library.

      **Implentation:**
      I changed one line in docs.json:

      ```json
      "icons": {
        "library": "fontawesome"
      }
      ```

      **Verification:**
      - No more 404 erors in Developer Tools
      - Used incognito mode to ensure fresh requests
      - Reloaded using mint dev
      - Visual confirmation (dark/light mode)
      - Cross-browser testing

      In the case where the customer would prefer to stick with Lucide, I would recommend the user to change the name of the icons instead with names that exist on https://lucide.dev/icons/.

      **Implementation Process:**
      1. I saw that there was an existing `openapi.json` file with API endpoints already, so I decided to update the existing file rather than create a separate one. In the webhooks section, I added the `newPet` webhook definition and the `Pet` schema in the components/schemas section to define the webhook structure.

      2. Next, I updated the `docs.json` configuration by adding the new "Web Hooks" section to navigation. I created a nested group structure with "Pets" as an expandable component containing a page for "Newpet" as shown in the target image.

      3. I created a `webhooks` folder under `api-reference` with `newpet.mdx` to reference the webhook endpoint. In the `newpet.mdx` file, I wrote:
      ```json
      ---
      title: "New Pet"
      openapi: "WEBHOOK newPet"
      ---
      ```
      to link to the OpenAPI webhook definition and enable automatic schema generation.
