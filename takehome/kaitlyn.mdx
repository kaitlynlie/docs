      Troubleshooting process:
      1. I right-clicked on the missing icon and selected "Inspect Element," receiving a 404 error code for all 3 icons in the console. 
      2. Looking at
      the URLs for the .svg files, I saw that the .svg was from Lucide, so I went to the Lucide website and found that these icons did not exist in the icon set.
      3. I went to docs.json to double-check the icon library. When hovering over the
      property in the IDE, the tooltip indicated that the default was supposed to be "fontawesome," not
      "lucide," so I decided to switch it to fontawesome instead and reloaded
      the page. The three missing icons ended up loading with the correct library.

      Implentation:
      I changed one line in docs.json:

      ```json
      "icons": {
        "library": "fontawesome"
      }
      ```

      Verification:
      - No more 404 erors in Developer Tools
      - Used incognito mode to ensure fresh requests
      - Reloaded using mint dev
      - Visual confirmation (dark/light mode)
      - Cross-browser testing

      In the case where the customer would prefer to stick with Lucide, I would recommend the user to change the name of the icons instead with names that exist on https://lucide.dev/icons/.
